# Attendance Check-In on Solana

This project implements a blockchain-based attendance system using Solana, where teachers create events or recurring class sessions and students check in by scanning a QR code and connecting their wallet. The system is designed to be simple, trustless, and tamper-resistant, demonstrating a practical use of Web3 for real-world academic attendance tracking and possible wider usage across global industries.
